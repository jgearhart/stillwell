## *Here, in 1924-1926, Stillwell first confronted the great monuments of classical antiquity, in a Greece that was better suited to the hardy traveler than to the casual tourist.*
### -T. Leslie Shear Jr., Professor Emeritus, the Department of Art and Archaeology

Richard Stillwell (1899-1982), Princeton *21 and *24, contributed enormously to the fields of classical archaeology and the history of architecture over his long and prolific career. He was dually committed to both Princeton University, where he was the Howard Crosby Butler Memorial Professor of the History of Architecture from 1926 to 1967, and to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, where he rose from Assistant Professor to Director of the School. Stillwell directed excavations at Corinth, the Athenian Agora, Antioch, Kourion, and Morgantina. In addition to teaching in both locations and publishing the results of five excavations across the Mediterranean he still had time to be Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Archaeology from 1954 to 1973.
